# Classic Snake Game

## Overview

This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using Processing. The game features a snake that grows longer as it consumes fruits while avoiding collisions with its own body and the game borders. The color of the increase in length is associated with the color of the fruit consumed. 

## Features

- Snake movement in four directions: up, down, left, and right.
- Fruits (banana and apple) randomly appear for the snake to consume, leading to the growth of the snake.
- Game over conditions: collision with the game borders or the snake's own body.
- Win condition: the player wins when the snake fills the entire game board.

## How to Play

1. Run the game using a Processing environment.
2. Use arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to control the snake's movement.
3. Consume fruits to grow the snake and increase your score.
4. Avoid collisions with the game borders and the snake's own body.
5. Try to fill the entire game board to win.
